These are slides that I use as a backdrop for talking about how the Documenting
the Now project is theoretically and operationally oriented. It is geared
towards social science and humanities audiences. I originally developed them for
the Documenting the Now 2017 [meeting] in Ferguson, but have adjusted them over
time as the project has evolved.
